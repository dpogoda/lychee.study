Privacy Policy
Effective Date: 2024-06-30

Introduction
Welcome to Lychee.study. We are committed to protecting your privacy and treating all personal information we receive from you with care and respect. This privacy policy aims to answer your questions about our privacy practices and principles.

Information We Collect
In the course of operating Lychee.study, we do not collect any personal information from our users. The only information we are aware of is the IP address of our users, as is customary with any internet connection necessary to access websites and applications. This information is solely used to facilitate communication between your device and our servers and is not used for any form of user tracking or collection of personal data.

Use of Information
We use internet communication solely for the pronunciation functionality, i.e., we download the pronunciation file from a server. Additionally, we use internet connectivity to check whether the user has the latest necessary app version. The user pulls the data from an endpoint and does not send any data for that except for data that is sent in every web page communication.

The IP address we determine is used exclusively for operational purposes to maintain a stable and secure connection to our services. We do not store, share, or use IP addresses for analysis or tracking purposes.

Data Security
To protect the data transmitted to our servers, we implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, in line with industry standards.

Changes to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in legal, technical, or business developments. When we update our privacy policy, we will take appropriate measures to inform you, consistent with the significance of the changes we make.
